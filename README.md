# data-diff-chat
Chat with the `data-diff` codebase

Purpose: Make it really easy to contribute to data-diff by chatting with the codebase via LLMs.

I'll make this in the form of a CLI tool to make it easy to chat anywhere I have a terminal open and this package is installed.

Tech Stack:

- chromadb

pip install --upgrade pip
